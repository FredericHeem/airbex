        <h1>Proof of reserve</h1>
        <p>Proof of reserve allows exchange operator to prove their
            assets are greater than their liabilities.
        <p>
        <p>If all users decides to withdraw their funds at the same
            time, the exchange should have enough crypto-currency in his
            wallet (assets) to cover user's funds (liabilities).
